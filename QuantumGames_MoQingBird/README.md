# QuantumGames_MoQingBird
It's just like Flappy Bird. Except it's an electron in a Stern Gerlach setup.

# What is the Stern Gerlach Setup?
The Stern-Gerlach experiment unexpectedly revealed the existence of spin back in 1922. Physicists Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach sent a beam of silver atoms through the poles of a magnet â€” whose magnetic field was in the z direction

That means that Stern and Gerlach expected to see one or three spots on the screen you see at right in the figure, corresponding to the different states of the z component of angular momentum.

The beam of silver atoms divides in two, depending on the spin of the 47th electron in the atom, so there are two possible states of spin, which came to be known as up and down.

# Aim of the Game

1. To understand the Stern Gerlach experiment.
2. To build curiosity about quantum mechanics.
3. To score as many points as possible. It is a game, after all.

# How to Play

Downlaod the GitHub repo and run the python file in any notebook.
