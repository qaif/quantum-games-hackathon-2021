You can clear quantum gates from the board by lining up three or more 
(a combination of two gates are restricted because of the high probability of occurrence) in a row, 
which is accomplished by swapping quantum gates in order to create an Identity gate.

Whenever the gates will create an Identity gate in the horizontal combination, the score is given according to the number of gates making the combination as follows: 
For 3,4,5,6,7,8 gate: the score is 10,20,30,40,50,60 respectively", "You need to achieve the given target in the given number of moves.
